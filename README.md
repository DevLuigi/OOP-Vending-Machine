# Welcome to my "OOP-Vending-Machine" Repository!
Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'll be practicing OOP. This repository is a personal playground for me to dive deep into the world of OOP and sharpen my problem-solving skills.

# My Goals

* To gain a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
* To implement various design patterns and principles of OOP from scratch.
* To apply OOP concepts to solve real-world problems and optimize code structure.
* To track my progress and improvements in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code.
